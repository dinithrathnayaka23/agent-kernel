"""Tool functions for the Volunteer Matching Platform.

- search_opportunities: deterministic scoring over data/opportunities.json. No agent/LLM
  call involved, so it's directly unit-testable (see tool_test.py).
- save_user_profile / load_user_profile: persist/read the current user's profile via a
  ChromaManager knowledge base, keyed by a stable user_id resolved internally (see
  _current_user_id) rather than passed in by the LLM — see the note on that function for why.

Bound to agents in agent.py via PydanticAIToolBuilder.bind([...]).

    The installed agentkernel version (0.8.1) does not propagate a chat request's user_id
    down to tools (verified directly: RequestBuilder._attach_additional_context explicitly
    excludes "user_id" as a "known field", and neither ToolContext nor Session exposes an
    acting-user accessor in this version) — an earlier draft of this function assumed a
    newer, unreleased acting-user-propagation feature only present in the monorepo's
    `develop` source, not in what this project actually depends on. Real behavior instead:

    - Slack: AgentSlackRequestHandler attaches the raw Slack event as
      AgentRequestAny(name="body", content=body); body["user"] is the Slack user id, which
      stays the same across separate conversations/threads (unlike session_id, which is the
      thread timestamp and changes per conversation) — so it's read directly from there.
    - Everything else (web frontend, CLI): falls back to the current Agent Kernel
      session.id. This only gives cross-*visit* memory if the caller reuses the same
      session_id across visits — the web frontend does this deliberately (persisted in
      localStorage, see static/index.html) instead of generating a fresh one per page load.
      The CLI gets a fresh session_id per run, so CLI memory only persists within one run.
